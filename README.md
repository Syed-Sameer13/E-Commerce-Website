## 🎯 Technical Showcase: Skills Demonstrated

This project intentionally uses a minimal stack to isolate and emphasize fundamental front-end skills:

| Skill Focus | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Semantic HTML5** | Used modern structural tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`) to ensure **accessibility** and clear content organization. |
| **Responsive Design** | Achieved a seamless, mobile-first layout using **Media Queries** to adjust styles for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports. |
| **CSS Grid Mastery** | Utilized **CSS Grid** for the product listing section, creating a robust, flexible, and adaptive card layout. |
| **Pure CSS Architecture** | Ensured **zero dependencies** (no frameworks or build tools) to demonstrate proficiency in writing clean, vanilla CSS. |
| **Performance Optimization** | The static nature guarantees extremely **fast load times** and a minimal resource footprint. |
